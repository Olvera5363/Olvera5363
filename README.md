Hi, I’m @Olvera5363 I live in Mexico an i actually learning about programing. im a software engineer.
I like to play videogeames a solve problems, my favourite thing ever is create PC builds. i spend hours and hours learning about new tech for hardware.
I’m currently learning Javascript because things in my life change, i worked as a vendor in a mall, but i don't really like it.
I want to work in Microsoft, actually i don't have the necesary things to become a member of Microsoft, but i think with hard work and learning new things i can match the profile.

If you are interested in my things, please contact me by my email: alex_olvera_5343@hotmail.com
